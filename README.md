# PagerdutyClient

Your interview will consist of building an application that uses the PagerDuty API.

You're welcome to do your interview in any language you like. Here, we've provided samples written in Ruby, Python, Java, JavaScript, and Elixir. Feel free to use the samples as a starting point, or not.


## Preparation

Before your interview, make sure that you can access the PagerDuty API and access the example data. Make sure that your environment has the libraries you need to make HTTP calls and handle JSON payloads.

Each sample code directory will have its own README.md that explains language specific setup for the sample. Make sure to read it if you plan on using the sample code.

If you start with our sample code, make sure you can run the appropriate http_get function against the PagerDuty API. You will need to change this code in order to get that to work properly.

You will need to incorporate an authorization header before you can access the API. You can use this one that provides example data:

```
Authorization: Token token=y_NbAkKc66ryYTWUXYEu
```
